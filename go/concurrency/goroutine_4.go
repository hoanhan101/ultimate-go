// --------------------------
// Goroutines and parallelism
// --------------------------

// This programs show how Goroutines run in parallel.
// We are going to have 2 P with 2 m, and 2 Goroutines running in parallel on each m.
// This is still the same program that we are starting with. The only difference is that we are
// getting rid of the lowercase and uppercase function and putting their code directly inside Go's
// anonymous functions.

// Looking at the output, we can see a mix of uppercase of lowercase characters. These Goroutines
// are running in parallel now.
