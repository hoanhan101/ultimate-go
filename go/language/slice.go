	// What actually happen here is that we have a slice but it has a pointer (as opposed to nil).
	// This is consider an empty slice, not a nil slice.
	// There is a semantic between a nil slice and an empty slice. Any reference type that set to
	// its zero value can be considered nil. If we pass a nil slice to a marshal function, we get
	// back a string that said null but when we pass an empty slice, we get an empty JSON document.
	// But where does that pointer point to? It is an empty struct, which we will review later.

		// The append call is working with value semantic. We are not sharing this slice but

		// If it is the same, it means that we have no room. append creates a new backing array,

		// on its stack frame and return us a copy. We replace our slice with the new copy.
		// If it is not the same, it means that we have extra elements of capacity we can use. Now we
		// can bring these extra capacity into the length and no copy is being made. This is very
		// efficient.

		// Looking at the last column in the output, when the backing array is 1000 elements or

	inspectSlice(slice3)

	// When we change the value of the index 0 of slice3, who are going to see this change?
	slice3[0] = "CHANGED"

	// The answer is both.
	// We have to always to aware that we are modifying an existing slice. We have to be aware who
	// are using it, who is sharing that backing array.
	fmt.Printf("\n=> Slice of slice (after)\n")
	inspectSlice(slice2)
	inspectSlice(slice3)

	// How about slice3 := append(slice3, "CHANGED")?
	// Similar problem will occur with append if the length and capacity is not the same.
	// Instead of changing slice3 at index 0, we call append on slice3. Since the length of slice3
	// is 2, capacity is 6 at the moment, we have extra rooms for modification. We go and change
	// the element at index 3 of slice3, which is index 4 of slice2. That is very dangerous.

	// So, what if the length and capacity is the same? Instead of making slice3 capacity 6, we set
	// it to 2 by adding  another parameter to the slicing syntax like this: slice3 := slice2[2:4:4]
	// When append looks at this slice and see that the length and capacity is the same, it wouldn't
	// bring in the element at index 4 of slice2. It would detach.
	// slice3 will have a length of 2 and capacity of 2, still share the same backing array.
	// On the call to append, length and capacity will be different. The addresses are also different.
	// This is called 3 index slice. This new slice will get its own backing array and we don't
	// affect anything at all to our original slice.

	// For each Chinese character, we need 3 byte for each one.
	// The UTF-8 is built on 3 layers: bytes, code point and character. From Go perspective, string
	// are just bytes. That is what we are storing.
	// In our example, the first 3 bytes represents a single code point that represents that single
	// character. We can have anywhere from 1 to 4 bytes representing a code point (a code point is
	// a 32 bit value) and anywhere from 1 to multiple code points can actually represent a
	// character. To keep it simple, we only have 3 bytes representing 1 code point representing 1
	// character. So we can read s as 3 bytes, 3 bytes, 1 byte, 1 byte,... (since there are only 2
	// Chinese characters in the first place, the rest are English)
	s := "世界 means world"

	// UTFMax is 4 -- up to 4 bytes per encoded rune -> maximum number of bytes we need to

	// character by character?
	// The answer is code point by code point.

	// code point. Then i is 6.
