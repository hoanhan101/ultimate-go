// ------------------
// Struct Composition
// ------------------

// Prototyping is important, as well as writing proof of concept and solving problem in the
// concrete first. Then we can ask ourselves: What can change? What change is coming? so we can
// start decoupling and refactor.

// Refactoring has to become a part of the development cycle.

// Here is the problem that we are trying to solve in this section.
// We have a system called Xenia that has a database.
// There is another system called Pillar, which is a web server with some front-end that consume
// it. It has a database too.
// Our goal is to move the Xenia's data into Pillar's system.

// How long is it gonna take?
// How do we know when a piece of code is done so we can move on the next piece of code?
// If you are a technical manager, how do you know your debt is wasting effort or not putting
// enough effort?
// Done has 2 parts:
// One is test coverage, 80% in general and 100% on the happy path.
// Second is about changes. By asking what can changes, from technical perspective and business
// perspective, we make sure that we refactor the code to be able to handle that change.

// One example is, we can give you a concrete version in 2 days but we need 2 weeks to be able to
// refactor this code to deal with the change that we know it's coming.

// The plan is to solve one problem at a time. Don't be overwhelm by everything.
// Write a little code, write some tests refactor. Write layer of APIs that work on top of each
// other, knowing that each layer is a strong foundation to the next.

// Let's not too hung out on the implementation details. It's the mechanics here that are
// important.
// We are optimizing for correctness, not performance. We can always go back if it doesn't perform
// well enough to speed thing up.

// Next step:
// ----------
// Decouple using interface.

// Pull knows how to pull data out of Xenia.
// We could do func (*Xenia) Pull (*Data, error) that return the data and error. However, this

// Functions are a great way of writing API because functions can be more readable than any method
// can. We always want to start with an idea of writing API from the package level with function.
